Some feedback:

- When we try to connect with wrong credentials, we are left in the reconnecting state, which. is not ideal. Is there any way we can distinguish wrong credentials from losing a connection?
- It would be good to write better error messages for the users. For example this one is for wrong url, which is not very helpful?
